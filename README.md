Custom Radix Layouts
===
A custom Drupal 8/9 module that provides the "Beast," "Brenham 
Plus," and "Brenham Plus Flipped" layouts that are missing
from the official Drupal 8/9 Radix module.

Requirements
---
To work properly, this module depends on the Radix Layouts 
module, version 8.4-1 (or newer):  
`composer require 'drupal/radix_layouts:^4.1'`

Authors
---
Robert LeBlanc and Travis Butterfield from Watts College at 
Arizona State University made the conversion from the original 
Drupal 7 versions of these layouts, based on work in the Radix 
Layouts module (version 8.4-1).
