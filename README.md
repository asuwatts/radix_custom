Custom Radix Layouts
===
Provides the "Beast," "Brenham Plus," and "Brenham Plus Flipped" layouts that are missing from the official Drupal 8/9 Radix module.

Requirements

To work properly, this module depends on the Radix Layouts module, version 8.4-1 (or newer):  
`composer require 'drupal/radix_layouts:^4.1'`
